        <h2>Hello, I'm Ujjwal Bhardwaj and I am a Software Development Engineer</h2>
    <p>I have experience in AWS Solutions Architecture and hold the following certifications</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</li>
      <li>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate</li>
      <li>AWS Certified Developer - Associate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have contributed to open source projects with varying technology stacks. Most notably, I have added new features and fixed bug in the Amazon
      SageMaker Python SDK. It is a high level open source library for training and deploying machine-learned models on Amazon SageMaker. I participated in and successfully cleared Google Summer of Code under the mentoring organization FOSSASIA.
      I contributed to the development of a CI/CD project that continuously generates and deploy documentation on every commit to Github repositories. You can find details around the project&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/imujjwal96/3c794cc86f7d5467dc2f41ccee8788f3"
